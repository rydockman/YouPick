# You Pick Project Overview
An app that provides people with info about local farms and when they can go pick their favorite crop, Berries, Apples, Corn, Etc.  
One end would be open for farmers to login and create accounts to provide up to date picking info. 
The other would be public and send out alerts to users of when harvest is available for certain crops and farms

# Implementation
This will be a 2 semester long project. 
Our first semester will focus on making a web application for farmers and users.
Our second semester will focus on implementing a mobile app for formers and users.

# Time Tracking

You will also start time tracking.  It's very simple.
1. First, when creating an issue, add a quick action ny writing /estimate #hh #mm
2. When you work on the issue, you write /spend #h #m

There are other useful actions like /done, /assign, /approve and /wip to name a few.

Here's the link to [Quick Actions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/quick_actions.html).
