# What is YouPick?

YouPick was built on the idea of empowering local communities by connecting them directly to farms that offer fresh produce and products. 
One end would be open for farmers to login and create accounts to provide up-to-date events and farm information. The other would be available to consumers to browse and receive alerts for when farms are having events or new product is in stock.

# What is You Pick For?

You Pick is a web, and later on will be a mobile app, that allows for users to instantly find out what fresh crops are available in the area. They are also able to schedule times and book appointments to go to the farms using features in the app.

# What problem does You Pick address?

You Pick addresses the issue of there not being a good looking, quick, all in one place, and easy to use way for consumers to find out about producers and farms that offer in-person product picking

# How does You Pick solve this issue?

We are solving the aforementioned issue by creating a simple and easy-to-use web and mobile app that will show every user a customizable range of farms and produce available in their local area. These users are then able to select a farm in their area and can schedule a harvesting time in the app. 
The farmers are also able to use our application to post their farm, post what products they have available, as well as post available appointments for consumers to come to their farm to pick food.
